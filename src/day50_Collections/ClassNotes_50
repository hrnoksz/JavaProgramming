package name: day50_Collections

Collections Framework: consists of multiple interface and each interface is implemented by classes
			     Collections is root

	Collection (I): it is dynamic sized
					it has ready methods
					it supports for non-primitives ONLY

					it can be extended by List, Set, Queue

				List (I):   duplicates are allowed, has index number-->insertion order is preserved

						ArrayList (C): it is array based class, therefore searching/accessing elements is faster.

						LinkedList (C): insertion /deletion of the element is faster

						Vector (C): is Synchronized ==> thread-safe, just like ArrayList

						Stack (C): is Synchronized ==> thread-safe. LIFO

								pop() ===> LIFO this method is only for stack class


				Set (I): duplicates are not allowed, does not have index number

						HashSet (C): Maintains random order. Its Performence is Fastest

						LinkedHashSet (C): Maintains insertion order

						TreeSet (C): Maintains sorted order, does not accept null


				Queue (I): duplicates are allowed, does not have index number. FIFO

							poll() ===> FIFO

						PriorityQueue (C): Maintains random order


						ArrayDequeue (C): Maintains insertion order


						LinkedList (C): Maintains insertion order

								    Both List and Queue, Therefore, it has index number and poll() method
