Topic: Collections Continue
				Set
				Queue

Package name: day49_Collections


Collection (I): doesn't have get() method, because some child of collection does not have index number
                such as set

        List, Set and Queue are three child interface of collection

		List (Interface): Has index, Allows Duplicates

		        - ArrayList (most using for SDET)
		        - LinkedList
		        - Vector --> it is used for synchronizing thread
		                     vector is synchronize version of arrayList
		        - Stack:
		                Last in, first out order (LIFO)


		Set (Interface): It is used to avoid duplicates

		        Does not have index, does not allow duplicates

				HashSet (Class): order is random, therefore it is the fastest one, accepts null values
				                 If the order is not matter, we use HashSet

				LinkedHashSet (Class): keeps the insertion order
				                       If the order is matter, we use LinkedHashSet
				                       It accepts null values

				TreeSet (Class): keeps sorted order, does not accept null


		Queue(I): PriorityQueue (C), ArrayDeque (C) and LinkedList (C)

		          child interface of Collection
		          Does not have index, but LinkedList has index
		          Duplicates are allowed
		          Insertion order NOT preserved
		          First-in, First out order (FIFO)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

		          PriorityQueue (C): It maintains RANDOM order like HashSet
		                             It does NOT accept null values like TreeSet

                  ArrayDeque (C): It maintains the insertion order like LinkedHashSet
                                  It accepts null values like HashSet and LinkedHashSet


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LinkedList is a special class which means it has "IS A" relationship both List and Queue
