OPERATORS
   * Arithmetic Operators
       - , + , / , * and modulus % (gives us remainder)
   * Unary Operators:
        + positive, - negative
        ++ increase value by 1  (we will use these creating loops)
        -- decrease value by 1
        ! not operator

   * Assignment Operators
       difference between   "=" (assigns a value) and "==" (checks if the statements are equal)

       "+=" : a += 20;  ---->  a = a + 20;   Shorthand Operators

   * Relational Operators : When we use relational operators result is BOOLEAN
        > greater than sign
        < less than sign
        >= greater equal
        <= less than equal
        == equal
        != not equal

    * Logical Operators
      & And operator , && Bitwise And Operator
      | Or operator , || Bitwise Or operator



   Control Flow Statements - Conditional Statements
   if (condition) {do this}  else { go here if it is false}

   if (condition 1 )- else if (condition 2) - else {}
