Today's Topics:
    - Review Scanner class, how to use it
    - Strings
        * methods that come from class
strings are created in two ways:
    -literal
    -new keyword
* when we create literal way, string is created in the "String Pool" (string constant pool
* immutable: not changing
* When we use string methods: substring, uppercase method...string manipulation methods,
the string is not changing in memory, just creating another one

*Strings: sequence of characters, each character representative number called "index number"
index number starts from ZERO

        String str = "Java";
                      0123

* is the length and index mean the same thing?
the length str = 4
LENGTH STARTS FROM ONE

// Why did we create Dynamic Substring example?
    -You want to find the index of a string then using
    this index you want to substring a certain part of the String
