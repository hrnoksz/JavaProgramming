Today's Topics:
1.Arraylist
    Arraylist is a resizable Array implementation
    Arrays: fixed size, primitive/Object
    Arraylist: flexible, not fixed size, stores Object only, comes with many useful methods
2.Custom Methods
    Access Modifier Specifier ReturnType MethodName(){
    Statements
    }
    Access-Modifier:
    public: always reachable
    protected: same package or subclasses(inheritance)  in the different package
    default: same package
    private: same class

3.Class & Object

    What is Class? : Template/blueprint, can be created without object

    instanceVariable: should be created outside all the methods and thet are attributes of objects
    initialization is NOT mandatory; we initialize with object creation, they default values
    we can access via Objects
    Many copies

    Car c = new Car();
    c.instanceVariableName;

    staticVariable = Belongs to class, ONE copy, reach by ClassName and ObjectName
    initialization is NOT mandatory
