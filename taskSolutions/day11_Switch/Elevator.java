/*
Create a class called Elevator. A variable named floorNumber is given, write a program that can display the floor info
			when floorNum is 1 -> print "Floor 1 selected. Companies: Lobby, Verizon, Starbucks"
			when floorNum is 2 -> print "Floor 2 selected. Companies: Cybertek, NASA, Intelsat"
			when floorNum is 3 -> print "Floor 3 selected. Companies: Lyft, BofA, Stake house"
			 anything else: print "Invalid floor - 6"

			 Note:
			 	Solution 1: use nested if statement
				Solution 2: use switch statement
				Solution 2: use if & switch statements mixed
